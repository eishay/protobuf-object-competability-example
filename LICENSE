    <p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC<br />
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM<br />
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>1. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>"Contribution" means:</p>
<p>    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and<br />
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
<p>    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
<p>    i) changes to the Program, and</p>
<p>    ii) additions to the Program;</p>
<p>    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are<br />
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a<br />
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone<br />
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to<br />
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in<br />
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not<br />
derivative works of the Program.</p>
<p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</p>
<p>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are<br />
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when<br />
combined with the Program.</p>
<p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,<br />
including all Contributors.</p>
<p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
<p>    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br />
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to<br />
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,<br />
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such<br />
derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>
<p>    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br />
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed<br />
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the<br />
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.<br />
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the<br />
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such<br />
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the<br />
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations<br />
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p>
<p>    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses<br />
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any<br />
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual<br />
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to<br />
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of<br />
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the<br />
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole<br />
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.<br />
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to<br />
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license<br />
before distributing the Program.</p>
<p>    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient<br />
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set<br />
forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its<br />
own license agreement, provided that:</p>
<p>    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
<p>    b) its license agreement:</p>
<p>    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and<br />
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and<br />
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and<br />
fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
<p>    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for<br />
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential<br />
damages, such as lost profits;</p>
<p>    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered<br />
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>
<p>    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such<br />
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or<br />
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. </p>
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<p>    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
<p>    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. </p>
<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the<br />
Program.</p>
<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if<br />
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the<br />
originator of the Contribution.</p>
<p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with<br />
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is<br />
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who<br />
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner<br />
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if<br />
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such<br />
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify<br />
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages<br />
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal<br />
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the<br />
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in<br />
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product<br />
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br />
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order<br />
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial<br />
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to<br />
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any<br />
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in<br />
any such claim at its own expense.</p>
<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product<br />
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that<br />
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties<br />
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such<br />
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the<br />
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br />
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court<br />
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial<br />
Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
<p>5. NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN<br />
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br />
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,<br />
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each<br />
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and<br />
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of<br />
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of<br />
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,<br />
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
<p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY<br />
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br />
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST<br />
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,<br />
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY<br />
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS<br />
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>7. GENERAL</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable<br />
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the<br />
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such<br />
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such<br />
provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to<br />
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a<br />
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient<br />
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In<br />
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program<br />
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)<br />
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under<br />
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to<br />
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does<br />
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of<br />
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,<br />
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as<br />
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement<br />
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and<br />
survive.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in<br />
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be<br />
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to<br />
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.<br />
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.<br />
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve<br />
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the<br />
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including<br />
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement<br />
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement<br />
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its<br />
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections<br />
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the<br />
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether<br />
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not<br />
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the<br />
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this<br />
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year<br />
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in<br />
any resulting litigation.</p>
